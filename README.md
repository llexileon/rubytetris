# Usage

    gem install gosu
    git clone git://github.com/llexileon/rubytetris.git

# Controls

* Down arrow to accelerate shape drop
* Left & Right arrows to move shape across the grid
* Z to rotate shape counter clockwise
* X to rotate shape counter clockwise

# Resources

I've tried to implement the mechanics of the game reasonably faithfully thus far.
For more information, see the [tetris wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tetris_(video_game)).
